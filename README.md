# MSE211-Lab1
The included matlab files allow one to simulate calculations to find the roots of a given equation.
This is written for MSE 211 lab1 finding the roots of equations using secant and bisection methods,
afterwards it is then implemented in finding the positions of a 4 bar link system
to find the position in ortientation of the actuating links due to a sweep of angles from [0,2pi]
